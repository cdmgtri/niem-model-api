The Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory contains the subject's personal identifying information, arrest information, and personal property information.  The Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory is one of 44 IEPDs developed by the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project to support information exchange between state and local government organizations throughout the state of California.
