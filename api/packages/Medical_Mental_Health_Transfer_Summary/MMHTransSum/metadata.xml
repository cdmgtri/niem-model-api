    <Summary>The Medical/Mental Health Transfer Summary IEPD was developed for the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project.</Summary>
    <Description>A Medical/Mental Health Transfer Summary details medical data about a subject.  The data is sent from the jail to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reception center if a subject is transferred from local custody to the jurisdiction of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.  The Medical/Mental Health Transfer Summary contains information pertaining to the subject, medications, and other medical history information.  The Medical/Mental Health Transfer Summary is one of 44 IEPDs developed by the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project to support information exchange between state and local government organizations throughout the state of California.  It could also be adapted for use in other states.</Description>
