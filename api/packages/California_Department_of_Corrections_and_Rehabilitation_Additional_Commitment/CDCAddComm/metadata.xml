    <Summary>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Additional Commitment IEPD was developed for the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project.</Summary>
    <Description>A California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Additional Commitment is used when the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation needs to report additional commitment information for an inmate.  The information is sent to the California Department of Justice in order to update the statewide criminal history file for the inmate.  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Additional Commitment contains inmate information, charge, enhancement, and sentencing information.  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Additional Commitment is one of 44 IEPDs developed by the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project to support information exchange between state and local government organizations throughout the state of California.  It could also be adapted for use in other states.</Description>
