    <Summary>The DNA Compliance IEPD was developed for the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project.</Summary>
    <Description>A DNA Compliance is a form sent from the jail to the Court indicating that a DNA collection has been taken from a subject as detailed in a DNA Order from the Court.  The DNA Compliance contains information describing when a DNA collection has been taken, whether DNA collection was taken previously, and a signature block. The DNA Compliance is one of 44 IEPDs developed by the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project to support information exchange between state and local government organizations throughout the state of California.  It could also be adapted for use in other states.</Description>
