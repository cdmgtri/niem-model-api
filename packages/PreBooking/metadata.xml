    <Name>Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory</Name>
    <Summary>The Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory IEPD was developed for the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project.</Summary>
    <Description>A Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory is completed when a subject is taken into custody by a Law Enforcement Agency (LEA).  The LEA sends the form to the Sheriff's Office.  The LEA also sends a Probable Cause Declaration and the Intake Form to the Sheriff's Office at the time of booking.  The Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory contains the subject's personal identifying information, arrest information, and personal property information.  The Booking Intake/Personal Property Inventory is one of 44 IEPDs developed by the California Department of Justice - Data Exchange Project to support information exchange between state and local government organizations throughout the state of California.  It could also be adapted for use in other states.</Description>
